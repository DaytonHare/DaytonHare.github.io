        <p>Hello again!</p>
        <p>
          My name is Dayton Hare. Below you'll find my portfolio and application materials. Generally in my work I try to explore the interplay between the
          natural world and the narratives we create around it, but I write plenty of pieces on other topics too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Below you&rsquo;ll find three works
          that reflect different aspects of my compositional approach: one for choir,
          one for chamber ensemble, and one for orchestra. The section for each piece contains a
          program note, audio recordings (full track + excerpts), video recordings (performance + score follower),
          and a downloadable score with an embedded PDF viewer. I've suggested a few excerpts for you to prioritize your listening, and 
          if you only listen to those it should only take you around 15 minutes. Listening to the full recordings for each piece would take you 24'15”. 
          I've also taken the liberty of attaching a few minute second excerpts of additional pieces at the bottom, if you happen to have three minutes more to spare. 
         

        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for your consideration, and I hope you enjoy these selections! If interested, you are also
          welcome to visit my <a href="https://daytonhare.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full website</a>
          which contains additional compositions and recordings.

          <p class="mb-2"><strong>Program Note:</strong></p>

          <p>
            The Colorado River is the lifeblood of the American Southwest. Starting
            from its source in the Rockies, throughout an otherwise arid region
            the river irrigates vast hectares of agricultural land and provides
            millions of people with drinking water. As one of those millions
            during my childhood, thoughts of where the water came from or where it
            went rarely crossed my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            But today, as climate change places an
            ever greater strain on the river system, I often think about its
            imperiled future. A combination of drought, poor planning,
            and bad policy nearly emptied the river's reservoirs last year,
            but for decades before it had been drying up downstream, dammed and
            diverted for human consumption. At the Colorado's mouth, where in
            centuries past the river formed an estuary with the Gulf of California,
            the desert has overtaken the riverbed and water rarely reaches
            the ocean. Now, like so much of the natural world in the anthropocene,
            the estuary exists only in the traces left behind in the memory of the
            earth.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            My piece follows the river's course, from the stillness of
            snow-capped peaks to the stillness of the dry desert riverbed,
            in my own small contribution to this memory.

          <p class="mb-2"><strong>Program Note:</strong></p>

          <p>
            Most of my friends could tell you that I have a tendency towards
            understatement, especially when it comes to talking about my inner life.
            When I say, then, that something is &ldquo;an object of some concern,&rdquo;
            you can be sure it's actually quite a large point of worry for me,
            the kind of anxiety-inducing thing I often become fixated on,
            turning around and around in my mind and worrying myself more
            all the while.
          </p>
          <p>
            This piece is about that experience of becoming stuck on a troubling
            feeling, in general, and about a specific worrisome fixation of mine
            in particular, the climate crisis. The piece opens with a violent
            plunge in the strings that mimics the feeling of suddenly
            awakening in the middle of the night, unable to breath.
            From there the trio propels itself forward with music that is
            unrelenting and obsessive, constantly straining higher and higher,
            threatening to snap, until finally it reaches its breaking point.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            This, of course, represents the experience of mounting anxiety, of
            becoming consumed by the feeling. But more than that, at the risk of
            being a bit too on the nose, I find that it also mimics the trajectory
            of global temperatures and the climate emergency.

          <p class="mb-2"><strong>Program Note:</strong></p>

          <p>
            When I was a kid I had an impossibly difficult time understanding lyrics in music. Whether it was the top
            40 hits on the car radio or hymns in church, my brain always wanted to classify the voices I heard as just more
            instruments, timbres and nothing more. It took a deliberate effort on my part to be able to hear the voices as
            actually saying something, as meaning something, adding an additional layer
            of communication to the message of the music.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-0">
            &lsquo;whereof one cannot speak&rsquo; in some ways tries to dramatize
            this experiential movement. It starts with the text &mdash; a little poem about
            language I cobbled together from fragments of Wittgenstein &mdash; broken into their smallest
            constituent phonemes, signifying nothing, functioning as sound alone. Over the course of the
            piece these sounds are pulled together into larger and larger chunks of the text, laboriously moved out
            of the realm of abstraction and, bit by bit, into recognizable language with meaning to convey. Only by the final
            sections of the piece can one actually hear what the words are trying to say.

            <strong>Title:</strong> spiral bound<br>
            <strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Orchestra<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> 10&#8242;<br>
            <em>No recordings currently available; to be premiered by the New York Youth Symphony in March, 2025</em>
          </p>

          <p class="mb-2"><strong>Description:</strong></p>

          <p>
            Over the last year or so, I've been returning again and again
            to the idea of spirals as a structure. A form built out of
            continuous recursion in ever tightening circles, the natural world
            seems full of them. Whether it's spiral seashells, leaf structures,
            weather formations like hurricanes, or any number of other examples,
            everywhere I seem to turn, there they are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Human psychology,
            too, seems to be imbued with them in the form of recurring, obsessive,
            thought patterns that are difficult to break free from. My spiral
            fixation is itself an example of this.
            So when I learned that this commissioned piece for the New York
            Youth Symphony was to be programmed alongside Brahms' final symphony,
            whose last movement is a magnificent passacaglia, it felt like the
            perfect opportunity to try it musically. A passacaglia, after all,
            is almost a kind of musical spiral, a repeating structure that
            governs the form and direction of the music.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            I set out to write my own, more-explicitly-spiral,
            less-explicitly-passacaglia passacaglia. Broadly speaking,
            the piece is built out of two contrasting types of material.
            The first, the  &ldquo;spiral&rdquo; theme, is a constantly
            transposing tone row that seems to circle back on itself,
            as if eating its own tail. Throughout the sections of the
            piece where it predominates, it undergoes a gradual process
            of intensification, starting extremely slow but
            getting faster and faster until, by the end, it has no
            choice but to disintegrate into chaos. The other type of
            material is a resistance to this process, a lyrical and
            reflective music that remains in a fixed harmonic place,
            contrasting with the spiral theme's harmonic itinerance.
            Over time, the spiral music infiltrates these calmer
            sections, wearing down their resistance, drawing them back
            into its orbit, until the piece, as it was ever bound to,
            has no choice but to spiral out of existence.
