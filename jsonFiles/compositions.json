        "programNote": "When I was a kid I had an impossibly difficult time understanding lyrics in music. Whether it was the top 40 hits on the car radio or hymns in church, my brain always wanted to classify the voices I heard as just more instruments, timbres and nothing more. It took a deliberate effort on my part to be able to hear the voices as actually saying something, as meaning something, adding an additional layer of communication to the message of the music. 'whereof one cannot speak' in some ways tries to dramatize this experiential movement. It starts with the text — a little poem about language I cobbled together from fragments of Wittgenstein — broken into their smallest constituent phonemes, signifying nothing, functioning as sound alone. Over the course of the piece these sounds are pulled together into larger and larger chunks of the text, laboriously moved out of the realm of abstraction and, bit by bit, into recognizable language with meaning to convey. Only by the final sections of the piece can one actually hear what the words are trying to say.",

Starting from its source in the Rockies, throughout an otherwise arid region the river irrigates vast hectares of agricultural land and provides millions of people with drinking water. As one of those millions during my childhood, thoughts of where the water came from or where it went rarely crossed my mind. But today, as climate change places an ever greater strain on the river system, I often think about its imperiled future. A combination of drought, poor planning, and bad policy nearly emptied the river's reservoirs last year, but for decades before it had been drying up downstream, dammed and diverted for human consumption. At the Colorado's mouth, where in centuries past the river formed an estuary with the Gulf of California, the desert has overtaken the riverbed and water rarely reaches the ocean. Now, like so much of the natural world in the anthropocene, the estuary exists only in the traces left behind in the memory of the earth. My piece follows the river's course, from the stillness of snow-capped peaks to the stillness of the dry desert riverbed, in my own small contribution to this memory.",

While I don't think of this piece as programmatic, per se, in my mind it nevertheless follows a kind of linear progression that tracks the movement of a storm as it moves towards and then away from a vantage point from which you can watch the shifting clouds and changing colors from afar.",

If we pay attention, we might even notice this process as it happens, but we are powerless to stop it, and unsure if we would want to.

The effects of that piece are evident, in one way or another, in much of my music, and so in remembrance of the composer who gave it life I decided to write butterfly effects, which is an amalgamation of quotes from Sept Papillons and newly composed material extrapolated from them. As a final tribute, I've also included a quotation from another of Saariaho's most beautiful works, Nuits, adieux, which was itself written as a memorial for her grandmother.",

Most often, I would circle down the sloping route to the river and follow the water's winding way. As the weeks wore on and the riverside paths grew more populous with stir-crazy quarantiners, I began to take these strolls in the moments just after dawn, when I could be alone with nature.\n\nOne mist-shrouded morning, out of the corner of my eye I glimpsed a blue heron balancing on one leg in shallow water, unperturbed by my presence. We watched one another silently for a few minutes, before the bird, with a nonchalant gesture, spread its wings and flew off down the river. It was a comfort, in that uncertain and chaotic time, to see a fellow creature so unbothered by its surroundings, seemingly at peace with the world. I carried that image with me, as a symbol, for months to come.",

In the city where I live, we had merely a light, ephemeral dusting that melted away within a day. This atypical weather inspired me to reflect on the things I loved and missed about snow, and on the precious, private experiences we are collectively losing in our warming world.
