              <p>In his music, composer Dayton Hare strikes a balance between lyricism and color, narrative and atmosphere. 
                  Often drawing inspiration from the natural world, Dayton hopes to raise questions about our relationship to our 
                  environment and elevate underappreciated beauty found around us. He has received fellowships from the Fulbright Program, 
                  the National Orchestral Institute + Festival, the Conservatoire américain de Fontainebleau, and the Norfolk New Music 
                  Workshop, and his work has been performed by Bent Frequency, Mammoth Trio, the Yale Percussion Group, Utari Duo, and others. 
                  Upcoming projects include commissions for the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival and Yale Planetary Solutions Climate Week. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Originally from Boulder, Colorado, Dayton received a master's of music from the Yale School of Music, and bachelor's 
                  degrees in music composition and English literature from the University of Michigan. During the 2024&mdash;25 year, 
                  he will take up residence at the Fondation des États-Unis in Paris as the recipient of the Fulbright-Harriet Hale Woolley 
                  Award in the Arts, where he will compose music that engages with the city’s climate change mitigation efforts.

          <p style="font-style: italic;">Outside of music, Dayton loves to read both fiction and non-fiction, spend time in nature,
            and hang out with his cat, Cleo. If you have any book suggestions, don't hesitate to drop him
            a line.
