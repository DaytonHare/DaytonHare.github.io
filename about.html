              <p>In his music, composer Dayton Hare strikes a balance between lyricism and color, narrative and atmosphere. 
                Often drawing inspiration from the natural world, Dayton hopes to raise questions about our relationship to our 
                environment and elevate underappreciated beauty found around us. His music has been performed nationally and internationally 
                at venues like Carnegie Hall and the Salle Cortot by groups such as Bent Frequency, the New York Youth Symphony, Stare at the Sun, 
                Ensemble Variances, Four Corners Ensemble, Mammoth Trio, the Yale Percussion Group, Utari Duo, the Norfolk Festival Chamber Choir, 
                and others. He has been awarded fellowships from the Fulbright Program, the National Orchestral Institute + Festival, the Gabriela 
                Lena Frank Creative Academy of Music, the Conservatoire américain de Fontainebleau, and the Norfolk New Music Workshop, and been 
                recognized with artist residencies at the Rabbit Island Foundation and the Vashon Artist Residency. He was the 2024-25 Grand Prize winner 
                of the New York Youth Symphony’s Jon Deak First Music Competition, and has won numerous calls for scores.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Originally from Boulder, Colorado, Dayton received a Master of Music from the Yale School of Music, and Bachelor's degrees in music 
                composition and English literature from the University of Michigan. During the 2024–25 year, he was in residence at the Fondation des États-Unis 
                in Paris as the recipient of the Fulbright-Harriet Hale Woolley Award in the Arts, where he composed music that engaged with the city's climate change 
                mitigation efforts.

            and hang out with his cat, Cleo. If you have any book suggestions, don't hesitate to drop him
            a line.
