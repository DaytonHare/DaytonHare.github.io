              <p>In his music, composer Dayton Hare strikes a balance between lyricism and color, narrative and atmosphere. 
                  Often drawing inspiration from the natural world, Dayton hopes to raise questions about our relationship to our 
                  environment and elevate underappreciated beauty found around us. 
                
                  He has received fellowships from the Fulbright Program, 
                  the National Orchestral Institute + Festival, the Conservatoire américain de Fontainebleau, and the Norfolk New Music 
                  Workshop. 

                  In addition, he has won various awards including the grand prize for the 
                  <a href="https://www.nyys.org/2024-25-jon-deak-first-music-winners/" target="_blank" style="color: #2e003e;">2024&ndash;2025 Jon Deek First Music Competition</a>,
                  resulting in a joint orchestral commission from the New York Youth Symphony and Interlochen Center for the Arts.

                  
                  His work has been performed by groups such as Bent Frequency, Mammoth Trio, the Yale Percussion Group, Utari Duo, 
                  the Norfolk Festival Chamber Choir, the New York Youth Symphony, and others.

              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Originally from Boulder, Colorado, Dayton received a Master of Music from the Yale School of Music, and Bachelor's 
                  degrees in music composition and English literature from the University of Michigan. During the 2024&ndash;25 year, 
                  he is in residence at the Fondation des États-Unis in Paris as the recipient of the Fulbright-Harriet Hale Woolley 
                  Award in the Arts, where he is composing music that engages with the city's climate change mitigation efforts.

          <p style="font-style: italic;">Outside of music, Dayton loves to read both fiction and non-fiction, spend time in nature,
            and hang out with his cat, Cleo. If you have any book suggestions, don't hesitate to drop him
            a line.
